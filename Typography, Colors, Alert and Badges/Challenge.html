        Our neutral view is underpinned by three factors:
        <span class="badge bg-white text-black">Low VNB relative to EV</span
        >which limits the potential-RoEV to near premium-unwind rate; lower APE
        growth and margin prospects vs. private sector peers as LIC’s higher
        commission costs and opex limit the scope for product and channel
        diversification; and inherent volatility in EV as
        <span class="badge bg-white text-black">~35 per cent</span> of non-par
        assets are in equity, and no track record of EV movement under the new
